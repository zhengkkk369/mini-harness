# Benchmark results

| Benchmark | Evaluation | Solved | Score |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| SWE-bench Verified | 500 tasks, one attempt per task | 401 / 500 | **80.2%** |
| Terminal-Bench 2.1 | 89 tasks, five attempts per task | 309 / 445 | **69.44%** |

Both archives identify the agent source version as `d8b0fb7`, the model as
`deepseek-v4-flash`, and the runner as Harbor 0.20.0. The Terminal-Bench run was
recorded on August 14–16, 2026; the SWE-bench run on August 20–22, 2026. The imported
source baseline is commit `d8b0fb7974ec934252df1e06488f65a494699002`, with project
naming updated. These historical scores do not evaluate the new TUI, Docker
sandbox tool, or subsequent fixes that preserve DeepSeek reasoning across tool
calls and conversation turns. The current source has not been re-evaluated on
these benchmarks.

The Terminal-Bench score averages all 445 attempts; it is **not pass@5**. The
SWE-bench denominator includes all 500 tasks, including two tasks without a
verifier reward. The archived Terminal-Bench dataset reference is
`sha256:7d7bdc1cbedad549fc1140404bd4dc45e5fd0ea7c4186773687d177ad3a0699a`.

### Public leaderboard context

The following are the nearest lower scores on the official pages inspected on
**September 4, 2026**. For SWE-bench, the comparison uses the complete Verified
view with **Bash Only disabled**, so custom harnesses are included.

| Benchmark | Public comparison entry | Listed score | Difference from this run |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| SWE-bench Verified | Sonar Foundation Agent + Claude Opus 4.5 | 79.2% | +1.0 percentage point |
| SWE-bench Verified | live-SWE-agent + Claude Opus 4.5, medium effort | 79.2% | +1.0 percentage point |
| Terminal-Bench 2.1 | Claude Code + Claude Opus 4.7, max effort | 68.9% | +0.54 percentage point |

[Terminal-Bench 2.1 official leaderboard](https://www.tbench.ai/?version=2.1).

These are numerical comparisons between separately run agent/model systems.
They do not isolate the harness effect or establish statistically significant
improvements. In particular, the Terminal-Bench comparison entry reports a
95% confidence interval of ±2.8 percentage points. The SWE-bench comparison
entries are listed submissions, not marked as checked by the SWE-bench team.
The scores here have not been accepted as official mini-harness leaderboard
submissions; they should not be described as an official rank or a SOTA claim.

The [README comparison figure](README.md#benchmarks) includes all **18 public
Terminal-Bench 2.1 entries** visible on that date plus this self-reported run.
Positions are recomputed by descending score, retaining ties. The inserted
mini-harness result is **13th of 19**, between Terminus 2 + Gemini 3 Pro (high),
73.9% ±2.5%, and Claude Code + Opus 4.7 (max), 68.9% ±2.8%. This is an
illustrative score order, not an official leaderboard placement. Public rows
show their published 95% confidence intervals; no interval was computed for
mini-harness.

### Recorded exceptions and reproducibility

The archived evaluations were **not error-free**:

- **Terminal-Bench 2.1:** 108 agent timeouts and five nonzero agent exits. All 445
  trials have verifier rewards. Among the 337 available run-telemetry records,
  all report the agent loop reaching its normal completion outcome; that does
  not mean all tasks were solved.
- **SWE-bench Verified:** one agent timeout, two nonzero agent exits, and two
  Docker environment-build failures. One nonzero exit records an API 400 error
  requiring `reasoning_content` to be passed back in thinking mode. This is a
  known API-message compatibility issue in the evaluated baseline.

The full archives are saved under the mini-harness name on Harbor Hub and are
currently **private**. Uploading archives to Harbor Hub is separate from official
leaderboard submission. This source-only repository includes the agent and its
unattended profile; the external Harbor adapter, job definitions, and raw
benchmark archives are not bundled, so the historical evaluations are not yet
reproducible from this checkout alone.

### Re-running today's source against these numbers

The recorded scores predate several mechanisms now in the default local profile.
Small-task behaviour that helps interactively would move a benchmark number
without the agent having changed, so the bench profile pins them to the
configuration the scores were produced under:

| Setting | Bench value | What it would otherwise cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verify_required` | `False` | an unverified edit would earn an extra turn |
| `parallel_tools` | `False` | read batches would overlap instead of running in order |
| `recall_enabled` | `False` | a tenth tool and an extra prompt line |

Everything else keeps its default, and a run that wants the new behaviour can
turn it back on through the environment. `tests/test_config.py` asserts both the
pinned values and that the bench prompt does not describe a tool the profile
disables.

Two differences cannot be pinned away, because they are in the source itself:

- **The tool set.** The recorded revision had nine tools; this one has ten, and
  `run_sandbox` is among the additions.
- **The prompt.** It has grown with the mechanisms that remain documented.

So a re-run today is comparable in *behaviour policy*, not identical in
*capability*. Any new score should say which source revision produced it, as the
existing scores do.
